Justification:

Within the Evo class, I implemented a get_best_solution method that identifies the best solution by iterating through
the scores of all non-dominated solutions and calculating a weighted average. Initially, I ensured that only
non-dominated solutions with zero conflicts were considered. This was my highest priority because, while morale and
scheduling are important, it is physically impossible for a TA to be in two lab sections simultaneously.

Next, I developed the weighted average. I assigned the greatest weight, 50%, to minimizing the "unwilling" penalty
because if a TA is unwilling to assist with a section, it is likely due to other commitments, which again would lead
to scheduling conflicts. The second-highest weight, 35%, was assigned to minimizing "undersupport." This objective
returns a penalty score across all sections, and its impact can vary significantly. For instance, an undersupport
penalty of 6 might mean six sections are short one TA each—a manageable situation—or that two sections are each
missing three TAs, which is far more critical.

I gave "overallocation" a weight of 14%. While ensuring TAs are not too overallocated is important, a small amount of
overallocation can be acceptable if the TAs are willing, as willingness is already addressed by the higher weight on
minimizing unwilling penalties. Finally, I assigned a weight of 1% to the "unpreferred" objective. Although less
critical than the others, it still plays a role. If all other factors are equal, we would prefer a solution with a
lower unpreferred penalty. However, it is not a major concern if a TA is in a section they are willing to teach,
even if it is not their first choice.

After calculating weighted averages for each non-dominated solution, the method returns the solution with the lowest
average. The solution selected here is optimal, with no penalties for overallocation, conflicts, undersupport, or
unwillingness, and only a small penalty score of 2 for the unpreferred objective. This means there are two instances
where a TA is assigned to a section they are willing to teach but did not rank as their top preference. Overall, this
result seems highly satisfactory.
